                <strong>Menu App</strong>
                This is a mock resturant's menu, which accesses all the menu
                items from an external source using React, rather than being
                hard coded in. My biggest struggle with this app was getting the
                menu items to be accurately listed while maintaining the proper
                styling. After getting it to work with one menu item, I was able
                to repeat this process for the rest of them.

                <strong>To-Do App</strong>
                This is a React Native app that allows users to create a virtual
                to-do list, with full functionality. They can check off
                completed items and add new items to work on. The most difficult
                aspect of this project was allowing the user to add new tasks
                with full funtionality, rather than just hardwire tasks they
                could select or deselect. However, once I was able to add the
                new tasks, it was simple keeping the functionality consistent.

                The reccomendations aspect was tricky to set up, but using the

                <strong>Quiz App</strong>
                This React Native app allows the users to take a quiz and see

                answer multiple choice, multiple select, or true-or-false
                questions. Getting the results summary to display with the users
                selections visible was difficult as originally, all answer
                choices would be marked based on what was correct or incorrect.
                After trial and error I managed to focus on the user's input
                instead.

                <strong>To-Do App Design</strong>
                This is a potential design for a to-do app. Including the
                ability for users to create new to-dos, delete uneeded ones and
                create a user account. I wanted this app to feel fully developed
                with its design so I designed screens from the login to the list
                creation to the user profile. I also wanted to ensure common
                functions like deleting and adding due dates would be available
                to ensure a range of features at the users disposal.

                ablility to search for other published studysets if they desire.
                I wanted this app's design to maintain some similar features as
                others of the same genre to ensure users would be able to use
                that knowledge with my design. I also wanted to add more
                features like being able to add images to each term and quickly
                flip between cards even without selecting a specific studyset.

                Using Figma, I created a wireframe for a collaborative project

                I created wireframes that covered the 5 sections accessible from
                the nav bar. After that I added a login screen and started to
                map out how the shade match quiz would be displayed.

                Expanding on the wireframes I created before, I made a prototype
                in Figma. My group helped create the hi-fidelity versions of my
                wireframes, and the I set to working on connecting elements to
                create a prototype of how the website would work once we started
                development. Ensuring that the connections created were
                intuitive required testing before moving on to the next step.

                <strong>Backend Development</strong>
                After developing the Front-End for Cosmira, with the hi-fidelity
                prototype as our guide, we need to develop our backend to
                display products to users , store and display user reviews and
                posts, and maintain other features like trending topics and
                community posts. In order to do so, I created a relational
                database for Cosmira, via phpMyAdmin, and created the tables
                necessary to store the information we needed. Then I used PHP to
                display the right information on our website.
