                <strong>Menu App</strong>
                This is a mock resturant's menu, which accesses all the menu items from an external source using React, rather than being hard coded in. My biggest struggle with this app was getting the menu items to be accurately listed while maintaining the proper styling. After getting it to work with one menu item, I was able to repeat this process for the rest of them.

                <strong>To-Do App</strong>
                This is a React Native app that allows users to create a virtual to-do list, with full functionality. They can check off completed items and add new items to work on. The most difficult aspect of this project was allowing the user to add new tasks with full funtionality, rather than just hardwire tasks they could select or deselect. However, once I was able to add the new tasks, it was simple keeping the functionality consistent.

Additionally, they can lap their times and are reccommened new exercises to try. The reccomendations aspect was tricky to set up, but using the different exercise categories made it simple to intergrate.

                    This React Native app allows the users to take a quiz and see their correct and inocrrect answers when done. The users can answer multiple choice, multiple select, or true-or-false questions. Getting the results summary to display with the users selections visible was difficult as originally, all answer choices would be marked based on what was correct or incorrect. After trial and error I managed to focus on the user's input instead.

                    This is a potential design for a to-do app. Including the ability for users to create new to-dos, delete uneeded ones and create a user account. I wanted this app to feel fully developed with its design so I designed screens from the login to the list creation to the user profile. I also wanted to ensure common functions like deleting and adding due dates would be available to ensure a range of features at the users disposal.

The user also has the ablility to search for other published studysets if they desire. I wanted this app's design to maintain some similar features as others of the same genre to ensure users would be able to use that knowledge with my design. I also wanted to add more features like being able to add images to each term and quickly flip between cards even without selecting a specific studyset.

            <p id="cosmiraBio">The following pieces are all related to a collaborative project entitled Cosmira. Cosmira is a community-based website created to help users find a truly accurate shade match in makeup. This applies to foundation, concealer, blush, and other face products. Since we developed Cosmira from a single idea, to a full website with backend intergration, there are a couple of aspects of the development process I wanted to highlight.   </p>

                        Using Figma, I created a wireframe for Cosmira. Focusing in the main pages needed navigation, I created wireframes that covered the 5 sections accessible from the nav bar. After that I added a login screen and started to map out how the shade match quiz would be displayed.

                            Expanding on the wireframes I created before, I made a prototype in Figma. My group helped create the hi-fidelity versions of my wireframes, and the I set to working on connecting elements to create a prototype of how the website would work once we started development. Ensuring that the connections created were intuitive required testing before moving on to the next step.

                            After developing the Front-End for Cosmira, with the hi-fidelity prototype as our guide, we need to develop our backend to display products to users , store and display user reviews and posts, and maintain other features like trending topics and community posts. In order to do so, I created a relational database for Cosmira, via phpMyAdmin, and created the tables necessary to store the information we needed. Then I used PHP to display the right information on our website.
